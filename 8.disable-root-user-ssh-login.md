# Disable Root User SSH Login

- Open config file and add `PermitRootLogin no` 

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

- Restart ssh service

    ```bash
    services ssh restart
    ```

    Note:- Before disabling root user SSH login, we need to give sudo privileges to a user so that we can later login and execute sudo commands.
