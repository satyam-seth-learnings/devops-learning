    sudo service nginx status
    ```

- Verify Web Server Ports are Open and Allowed through Firewall

    ```sh
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```

- Copy Project from Local Machine to Remote Server or VPS. There are two ways to do it:-

    1. Using scp command

        - Note:- You can Copy Complete Project Folder by making it a Zip File then Unzip it on Server.

        - On Local Windows Machine Make Your Project Folder a Zip File using any of the software e.g. winzip

            - Copy Zip File from Local Windows Machine to Linux Remote Server

                - Syntax:- 

                    ```sh
                    scp -P <port_no> <source_file_path> <username>@<ip-address>:<destination_path>
                    ```


                - Example:- 

                    ```sh
                    scp -P 22 project.zip root@216.32.44.12:/var/www
                    ```

        - Run Below Commands on Your Remote Server Linux Machine or VPS, Not on Your Local Windows Machine

            - Go to the Destination Path(Web server Public Directory `/var/www/`) Where you copied the zip file

                - Syntax:-

                    ```sh
                    cd <destination_path>
                    ```

                - Example:-

                    ```sh
                    cd /var/www
                    ```

            - Run ls command to verify that the zip file is present

                ```sh
                ls
                ```

            - Unzip the Copied Zip File

                - Syntax:-

                    ```sh
                    unzip <zip_file_name>
                    ```

                - Example:-

                    ```sh
                    unzip project.zip
                    ```

    2. Using git clone command

        - Open Project on VS Code then add .gitignore file (If needed)

        - Push your Project to Your Github Account as Private Repo

        - Note:- Run Below Commands on Your Remote Server Linux Machine or VPS, Not on Your Local Windows Machine
                
        - Make Connection between Remote Server and Github Repo via SSH Key

            - Generate SSH Keys

                ```sh
                ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-email>"
                ```

            - If Permission Denied then Own .ssh then try again to Generate SSH Keys

                - Syntax:-

                    ```sh
                    sudo chown -R <user-name> .ssh
                    ```

                - Example:- 

                    ```sh
                    sudo chown -R try-nginx .ssh
                    ```

            - Open Public SSH Keys then copy the key

                ```sh
                cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
                ```

            - Go to Your Github Repo

            - Click on Settings Tab

            - Click on Deploy Keys option from sidebar

            - Click on Add Deploy Key Button and Paste Remote Server's Copied SSH Public Key then Click on Add Key

            - Verify the Connection, Go to Your Server Terminal then run below

                ```sh
                ssh -T git@github.com
                ```

                Or

                ```sh
                ssh -vT git@github.com
                ```

            - You may get an error git @ github.com: Permission denied (publickey) If you will try to clone it directly on Web Server Public Folder /var/www So we will clone github repo in User's Home Directory then Move it to Web server Public Directory


        - Clone Project from your github Repo using SSH Path It requires to setup SSH Key on Github

            - Syntax:-

                ```sh
                git clone <ssh-repo-path>
                ```

            Example:- 

                ```sh
                git@github.com:satyam-seth-learnings/deploy-react-js-project-via-github-deploy.git
                ```

        - Move Project Folder to Web Server public directory

            Syntax:-

                ```sh
                mv <source_path> <destination_path>
                ```

            Example:-

                ```sh
                sudo mv react-js-project /var/www

- Install Dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

- Build React Project

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

- Create Virtual Host File

    - Syntax:-

        ```sh
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your_domain>
        ```

    - Example:-

        ```sh
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/react-js-project.com
        ```

- Write following Code in Virtual Host File

    ```conf
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name <your_domain> www.<your_domain>;
        root /var/www/<project_folder_name>/<production_build_folder_name>;
        index index.html;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }
    ```

- Enable Virtual Host or Create Symbolic Link of Virtual Host File

    - Syntax:-

        ```sh
        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<virtual-host-file> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<virtual-host-file>
        ```

    - Example:-

        ```sh
        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/react-js-project.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/react-js-project.com
        ```

- Check Configuration is Correct or Not

    ```sh
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

- Restart Nginx Configuration

    ```sh
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```

- Now you can make some changes in your project local development VS Code and Pull it on Remote Server (Only if you have used Github)

    - Go to Your Project Directory

        ```sh
        cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
    ```

    - Pull the changes from github repo

        ```sh
        git pull origin main
        ```

    - Create Production Build

        ```sh
        npm run build
        ```

- Automate React JS Deployment using Github Action

    - On Your Local Machine, Open Your Project using VS Code or any Editor

    - Create A Folder named .scripts inside your root project folder e.g. `react-js-project/.scripts`

    - Inside .scripts folder Create A file with .sh extension e.g. `react-js-project/.scripts/deploy.sh`

    - Write below script inside the created `.sh` file

        ```sh
        #!/bin/bash
        set -e

        echo "Deployment started..."

        # Pull the latest version of the app
        git pull origin main
        echo "New changes copied to server !"

        echo "Installing Dependencies..."
        npm install --yes

        echo "Creating Production Build..."
        npm run build

        echo "Deployment Finished!"
        ```

    - Go inside `.scripts` Folder then Set File Permission for `.sh` File

        ```sh
        git update-index --add --chmod=+x deploy.sh
        ```

    - Create Directory Path named `.github/workflows` inside your root project folder e.g. `react-js-project/.github/workflows`
    
    - Inside workflows folder Create A file with `.yml` extension e.g. `react-js-project/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
    
    - Write below script inside the created `.yml` file

        ```yml
        name: Deploy

        # Trigger the workflow on push and
        # pull request events on the main branch
        on:
        push:
            branches: ["main"]
        pull_request:
            branches: ["main"]

        # Authenticate to the the server via ssh
        # and run our deployment script
        jobs:
        deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - name: Deploy to Server
                uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
                with:
                host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
                username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
                port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
                key: ${{ secrets.SSHKEY }}
                script: "cd /var/www/<outer_project_folder> && ./.scripts/deploy.sh"
        ```
       
    - Commit and Push the change to Your Github Repository

    - Go to Your Project Directory

        ```sh
        cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
        ```

    - Pull the changes from github just once this time

        ```sh
        git pull
        ```
    
    - Go to Your Github Repository Click on Settings

    - Click on Secrets and Variables from the Sidebar then choose Actions

    - On Secret Tab, Click on New Repository Secret
    
    - Add Four Secrets HOST, PORT, USERNAME and SSHKEY as below

        ```txt
        Name: HOST
        Secret: <your_server_ip>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: PORT
        Secret: <your_server_ssh_port>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: USERNAME
        Secret: <your_server_user_name>
        ```

        - You can get Server User Name by login into your server via ssh then run below command

            ```sh
            whoami
            ```

    - Generate SSH Key for Github Action by Login into Remote Server then run below command OR You can use old SSH Key But I am creating New one for Github Action

        - Syntax:-
        
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f key_path -t ed25519 -C "<your_email>"
            ```

        - Example:- 
            
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f /home/satyam-seth/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519 -t ed25519 -C "gitactionautodeploy"
            ```

    - Open Newly Created Public SSH Keys then copy the key

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519.pub
        ```

    - Open authorized_keys File which is inside `.ssh/authroized_keys` then paste the copied key in a new line

        ```sh
        nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```

    - Open Newly Created Private SSH Keys then copy the key, we will use this key to add New Repository Secret On Github Repository

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: SSHKEY
        Secret: <private_ssh_key_generated_on_server>
        ```

- Your Deployment should become automate.

- On Local Machine make some changes in Your Project then Commit and Push to Github Repo It will automatically deployed on Live Server

- You can track your action from Github Actions Tab

- If you get any File Permission error in the action then you have to change file permission accordingly

- All Done
