# Deploy Next JS Project with Apache Web Server via GitHub

- [Point Domain to VPS](https://github.com/satyam-seth-learnings/devops-learning/tree/main/15.point-domain-and-host-html-website-on-remote-server)

- Open Project on VS Code then add .gitignore file also create .env.example file (If needed)

- Push your Project to You Github Account as Private Repo
   
- Verify that all required softwares are installed

    - Check Node installed

        ```sh
        node -v
        ```
    
    - Check NPM installed

        ```sh
        npm -v
        ```

    - Check Apache Web Server installed

        ```sh
        apache2 -v
        ```

    - Check [`PM2`](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) installed

        ```sh
        pm2 --version
        ```

        #### What is PM2 ?

        PM2 is a powerful, widely-used, and feature-rich, production-ready process manager for Node.js. Restarting PM2 with the processes it manages every time your server boots/reboots is critical. One of PM2â€™s key features is support for a startup script (generated dynamically based on the default init system on your server), that restarts PM2 and your processes at every server restart.

- If Required Softwares and Modules are not Installed then Install them

    - [Install Node and NPM](https://github.com/satyam-seth-learnings/devops-learning/blob/main/44.install-node-and-npm.md)

    - Install Apache Web Server

        ```sh
        sudo apt install apache2
        ```

    - Install PM2

        ```sh
        sudo npm install -g pm2@latest
        ```

- Add PM2 Process on Startup

    ```sh
    sudo pm2 startup
    ```

- Verify Apache2 is Active and Running

    ```sh
    sudo service apache2 status
    ```

- Verify Web Server Ports are Open and Allowed through Firewall

    ```sh
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```

- Make Connection between Remote Server and Github via SSH Key
    
    - Generate SSH Keys

        ```sh
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your_email>"
        ```

        - Note:- you can use any identifier string instead of your email

        - If Permission Denied then Own .ssh then try again to Generate SSH Keys

            - Syntax:-

                ```sh
                sudo chown -R <user_name> .ssh
                ```

            - Example:-

                ```sh
                sudo chown -R satyam-seth .ssh
                ```

    - Open Public SSH Keys then copy the key

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```

    - Go to Your Github Repository

    - Click on Settings Tab
    
    - Click on Deploy Keys option from sidebar
    
    - Click on Add Deploy Key Button and Paste Remote Server's Copied SSH Public Key then Click on Add Key
    
    - Verify the Connection, Go to Your Server Terminal then run below

        ```sh
        ssh -T git@github.com
        ```

        or

        ```sh
        ssh -vT git@github.com
        ```

- Clone Project from your github account

    - Using HTTPS Path It doesn't require to setup SSH Key on Github

        - Syntax:-
        
            ```sh
            git clone <https_repo_path>
            ```

        - Example:-

            ```sh
            https://github.com/satyam-seth-learnings/deploy-next-js-project-with-apache-web-server-via-github-deploy.git
            ```

    - Using SSH Path It requires to setup SSH Key on Github

        - Syntax:-
        
            ```sh
            git clone <ssh_repo_path>
            ```

        - Example:-

            ```sh
            git@github.com:satyam-seth-learnings/deploy-next-js-project-with-apache-web-server-via-github-deploy.git
            ```

    - You may get an error git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey) If you will try to clone it directly on Web Server Public Folder /var/www So we will clone github repo in User's Home Directory then Move it to Web server Public Directory

- Run ls command to verify that the project is present

    ```sh
    ls
    ```

- Move Project Folder from User Home to Web Server Public Directory

    ```sh
    sudo mv <project_folder_name> /var/www
    ```

    - Note:- We can serve our project from any location, but we want to move it to `/var/www/` directory.

- Go to Your Project Directory

    ```sh
    cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
    ```

- Clear NPM Cache (Optional)

    ```sh
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

- Install Dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

- Create Production Build

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

- Create Virtual Host File

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/<your_domain>.conf
    ```

    - Add Following Code in Virtual Host File (Change the IP and Port According to your Node Application Code)

    ```xml
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName <your_domain>
        ServerAdmin <your_admin_email>
        ProxyPreserveHost On
        #Write Your own Port
        ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
        <Directory "/var/www/<project_folder_name>">
            AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

- Check Configuration is correct or not

    ```sh
    sudo apache2ctl configtest
    ```

- Enable the Proxy module with Apache

    ```sh
    sudo a2enmod proxy
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo a2enmod proxy_http
    ```

- Enable Virtual Host

    ```sh
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo a2ensite <your_domain>.conf
    ```

- Restart Apache2

    ```sh
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```

- Start Node Express Application using pm2

    ```sh
    cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo pm2 start npm --name <process-name> -- run start -- -p 3000
    ```

- Save PM2 Process

    ```sh
    sudo pm2 save
    ```

- Check PM2 Status

    ```sh
    sudo pm2 status
    ```

- Now you can make some changes in your project local development VS Code and Pull it on Remote Serve

- Go to Your Project Directory

    ```sh
    cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
    ```

- Pull the changes from github repo

    ```sh
    git pull
    ```

- Install Dependencies (If needed)

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

- Create Production Build

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

- Reload pm2 process

    ```sh
    sudo pm2 reload <process-name>
    ```
