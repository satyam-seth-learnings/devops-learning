# Point Domain and Host HTML Static Project using Github on Nginx Web Server

- Login to Your Domain Provider Website

- Navigate to Manage DNS

- Add Following Records:

    | Type | Host/Name | Value |
    | :---: | :---: | :--- |
    | A     | @     | Your Remote Server IP |
    | A     | www   | Your Remote Server IP |
    | AAAA  | @     | Your Remote Server IPv6 |
    | AAAA  | www   | Your Remote Server IPv6 |

- Open Project on VS Code then add .gitignore file (If needed)

- Push your Project to Your Github Account as Private Repo

- Note:- Run Below Commands on Your Remote Server Linux Machine or VPS, Not on Your Local Windows Machine

- Verify that all required softwares are installed

    - Check git installed or not

        ```sh
        git --version
        ```
        
    - Install Git if not installed

        ```sh
        sudo apt install git
        ```

    - Check nginx installed or not

        ```sh
        nginx -v
        ```

    - Install Nginx if not installed

        ```sh
        sudo apt install nginx
        ```

- Verify Nginx is Active and Running

    ```sh
    sudo service nginx status
    ```

- Verify Web Server Ports are Open and Allowed through Firewall

    ```sh
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```

- Make Connection between Remote Server and Github Repo via SSH Key

    - Generate SSH Keys

        ```sh
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-email>"
        ```

    - If Permission Denied then Own .ssh then try again to Generate SSH Keys

        - Syntax:-

            ```sh
            sudo chown -R <user-name> .ssh
            ```

        - Example:- 

            ```sh
            sudo chown -R try-nginx .ssh
            ```

    - Open Public SSH Keys then copy the key

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```

    - Go to Your Github Repo

    - Click on Settings Tab

    - Click on Deploy Keys option from sidebar

    - Click on Add Deploy Key Button and Paste Remote Server's Copied SSH Public Key then Click on Add Key

    - Verify the Connection, Go to Your Server Terminal then run below

        ```sh
        ssh -T git@github.com
        ```

        Or

        ```sh
        ssh -vT git@github.com
        ```

    - You may get an error git @ github.com: Permission denied (publickey) If you will try to clone it directly on Web Server Public Folder /var/www So we will clone github repo in User's Home Directory then Move it to Web server Public Directory


- Clone Project from your github Repo using SSH Path It requires to setup SSH Key on Github

    - Syntax:-

        ```sh
        git clone <ssh-repo-path>
        ```

    Example:- 

        ```sh
        git@github.com:satyam-seth-learnings/deploy-html-static-website-deploy.git
        ```

- Create Virtual Host File

    - Syntax:-

    - Example:-

        ```sh
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/html-project.com
        ```

    ```sh
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

- Restart Nginx Configuration

    ```sh
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```
    

- Automate Django Deployment using Github Action

    - On Your Local Machine, Open Your Project using VS Code or any Editor

    - Create A Folder named .scripts inside your root project folder e.g. `html-project/.scripts`

    - Inside .scripts folder Create A file with `.sh` extension e.g. `html-project/.scripts/deploy.sh`
    
    - Write below script inside the created `.sh` file

        ```sh
        #!/bin/bash
        set -e

        echo "Deployment started ..."

        # Pull the latest version of the app
        git pull origin main
        echo "New changes copied to server !"

        echo "Deployment Finished!"
        ```

    - Go inside `.scripts` Folder then Set File Permission for `.sh` File

        ```sh
        git update-index --add --chmod=+x deploy.sh
        ```

    - Create Directory Path named `.github/workflows` inside your root project folder e.g. `html-project/.github/workflows`

    - Inside workflows folder Create A file with `.yml` extension e.g. `html-project/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

    - Write below script inside the created `.yml` file

        ```yml
        name: Deploy

        # Trigger the workflow on push and
        # pull request events on the main branch
        on:
          push:
            branches: ["main"]
          pull_request:
            branches: ["main"]

        # Authenticate to the the server via ssh
        # and run our deployment script
        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v3
              - name: Deploy to Server
                uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
                with:
                  host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
                  username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
                  port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
                  key: ${{ secrets.SSHKEY }}
                  script: "cd /var/www/<outer_project_folder> && ./.scripts/deploy.sh"
        ```

    - Commit and Push the change to Your Github Repository

    - Go to Your Project Directory

        ```sh
        cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
        ```

    - Pull the changes from github just once this time

        ```sh
        git pull
        ```

    - Go to Your Github Repository Click on Settings

    - Click on Secrets and Variables from the Sidebar then choose Actions

    - On Secret Tab, Click on New Repository Secret
    
    - Add Four Secrets HOST, PORT, USERNAME and SSHKEY as below

        ```txt
        Name: HOST
        Secret: <your_server_ip>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: PORT
        Secret: <your_server_ssh_port>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: USERNAME
        Secret: <your_server_user_name>
        ```

        - You can get Server User Name by login into your server via ssh then run below command

            ```sh
            whoami
            ```

    - Generate SSH Key for Github Action by Login into Remote Server then run below command OR You can use old SSH Key But I am creating New one for Github Action

        - Syntax:-
        
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f key_path -t ed25519 -C "<your_email>"
            ```

        - Example:- 
            
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f /home/satyam-seth/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519 -t ed25519 -C "gitactionautodeploy"
            ```

    - Open Newly Created Public SSH Keys then copy the key

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519.pub
        ```

    - Open authorized_keys File which is inside `.ssh/authroized_keys` then paste the copied key in a new line

        ```sh
        nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```

    - Open Newly Created Private SSH Keys then copy the key, we will use this key to add New Repository Secret On Github Repository

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: SSHKEY
        Secret: <private_ssh_key_generated_on_server>
        ```

- Your Deployment should become automate.

- On Local Machine make some changes in Your Project then Commit and Push to Github Repo It will automatically deployed on Live Server

- You can track your action from Github Actions Tab

- If you get any File Permission error in the action then you have to change file permission accordingly

- All Done
