# Deploy Django Project with Apache Web Server via GitHub Actions

- [Deploy Django Project with Apache Web Server via GitHub](https://github.com/satyam-seth-learnings/devops-learning/tree/main/41.deploy-django-project-with-apache-web-server-via-github)

- Automate Django Deployment using Github Action

    - On Your Local Machine, Open Your Project using VS Code or any Editor

    - Create A Folder named .scripts inside your root project folder e.g. `django-project/.scripts`

    - Inside .scripts folder Create A file with `.sh` extension e.g. `django-project/.scripts/deploy.sh`
    
    - Write below script inside the created `.sh` file


        ```sh
        #!/bin/bash
        set -e

        echo "Deployment started ..."

        # Pull the latest version of the app
        git pull origin main
        echo "New changes copied to server !"

        # Activate Virtual Env
        source <virtual_env_name>/bin/activate
        echo "Virtual env '<virtual_env_name>' Activated !"

        echo "Installing Dependencies..."
        pip install -r requirements.txt --no-input

        echo "Serving Static Files..."
        python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

        echo "Running Database migration"
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

        # Deactivate Virtual Env
        deactivate
        echo "Virtual env '<virtual_env_name>' Deactivated !"

        # Reloading Application So New Changes could reflect on website
        pushd <inner_project_folder>
        touch wsgi.py
        popd

        echo "Deployment Finished!"
        ```

    - Go inside `.scripts` Folder then Set File Permission for `.sh` File

        ```sh
        git update-index --add --chmod=+x deploy.sh
        ```

    - Create Directory Path named `.github/workflows` inside your root project folder e.g. `django-project/.github/workflows`

    - Inside workflows folder Create A file with `.yml` extension e.g. `django-project/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

    - Write below script inside the created `.yml` file

        ```yml
        name: Deploy

        # Trigger the workflow on push and
        # pull request events on the main branch
        on:
          push:
            branches: ["main"]
          pull_request:
            branches: ["main"]

        # Authenticate to the the server via ssh
        # and run our deployment script
        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v3
              - name: Deploy to Server
                uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
                with:
                  host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
                  username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
                  port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
                  key: ${{ secrets.SSHKEY }}
                  script: "cd /var/www/<outer_project_folder> && ./.scripts/deploy.sh"
        ```

    - Commit and Push the change to Your Github Repository

    - Go to Your Project Directory

        ```sh
        cd /var/www/<project_folder_name>
        ```

    - Pull the changes from github just once this time

        ```sh
        git pull
        ```

    - Go to Your Github Repository Click on Settings

    - Click on Secrets and Variables from the Sidebar then choose Actions

    - On Secret Tab, Click on New Repository Secret
    
    - Add Four Secrets HOST, PORT, USERNAME and SSHKEY as below

        ```txt
        Name: HOST
        Secret: <your_server_ip>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: PORT
        Secret: <your_server_ssh_port>
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: USERNAME
        Secret: <your_server_user_name>
        ```

        - You can get Server User Name by login into your server via ssh then run below command

            ```sh
            whoami
            ```

    - Generate SSH Key for Github Action by Login into Remote Server then run below command OR You can use old SSH Key But I am creating New one for Github Action

        - Syntax:-
        
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f key_path -t ed25519 -C "<your_email>"
            ```

        - Example:- 
            
            ```sh
            ssh-keygen -f /home/satyam-seth/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519 -t ed25519 -C "gitactionautodeploy"
            ```

    - Open Newly Created Public SSH Keys then copy the key

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519.pub
        ```

    - Open authorized_keys File which is inside `.ssh/authroized_keys` then paste the copied key in a new line

        ```sh
        nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```

    - Open Newly Created Private SSH Keys then copy the key, we will use this key to add New Repository Secret On Github Repository

        ```sh
        cat ~/.ssh/gitaction_ed25519
        ```

        ```txt
        Name: SSHKEY
        Secret: <private_ssh_key_generated_on_server>
        ```

- Your Deployment should become automate.

- On Local Machine make some changes in Your Project then Commit and Push to Github Repo It will automatically deployed on Live Server

- You can track your action from Github Actions Tab

- If you get any File Permission error in the action then you have to change file permission accordingly

- All Done
